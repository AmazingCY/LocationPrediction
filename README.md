# LocationPrediction

## 1. Introduction

 __This model is used for location prediction by improved RNNs.__  
    __We follow the work from Flashback(https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/0302.pdf).
    Thanks for the original code from https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/Flashback_code. Based on it,
    we have extended the framework, and added new methods for more tasks.__
